Self Test Exercises

1. Given the declaration for two variables called feet and inches. Both variables are int and both are initialized to 0 in the declaration. Use both initialiation alternatives.
  int main()
{
    int feet,inches;
    inches = 0;
    feet = 0;
 }   



2. Give the declaration for two variables called count and distance. Count is int and initialized to 0, distance is a double and initialized to 1.5

int main()
{
    int count;
    double distance;
    count = 0;
    distance = 1.5 ;
}



3. Give a C++ statement that will change the value of the sum to the sum of values n1 and n2

int main()
{
    int n1, n2;
    int sum = n1+n2;
}


4. Give a C++ statememt that will increase the value of variable length by 8.3. The variable length is of type double
int main()
{
    double length;
    length = length + 8.3;
}



5. Give a C++ statement that will change the value of the variable product to its old value multiplied by the value of variable n. All are int. 

int main()
{
    int product;
    product = product * n
}


6. Write a program that contains statements that output the value of five or 6 variables that have been declared, but not initialized. What is the output. 

  If it's been declared but not initialized, then nothing will happen. Code will run regardless. If you try to print it, value will return 0. 

7. Give variable names for each of the following:
  a. Variable to hold speed of an automobile : speed_variable
  b. Variable to hold pay rate for hourly employee: hourly_pay
  c. Variable to hold highest score in an exam: high_score
  
  
8. Type an output that will produce the following message on screen: 
  The answer to the question of
  Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42.
  
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "The answer to the question of \n"
        << "Life, the Universe and Everything is 42";
}
  
  
9. Give an input statement that will fill the variable the_number (an int) with a number typed in. Prompt the user for a whole number
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number1;
    cout << "Give me a whole number \n";
    cin >>  number1;
    cout <<"The number you typed in is : " << number1 << endl;
}


10. What statements should you include to ensure that a double will output in ordinary notation with 3 digits after the decimal point?
cout.setf(ios::fixed);
cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
cout.precision(3);



11. Write a C++ program that prints Hello World on the screen
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World";
}


12. Write a C++ program that reads in two whole numbers and outputs their sum. 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number1, number2;
    cout << "Give me a whole number \n";
    cin >>  number1;
    cout << "Give me another whole number \n";
    cin >>  number2;
    cout <<"The sum of the numbers you typed is: " << number1+ number2 << endl;
}



13. Give an output statement that produces the new line character and a tab character

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << endl << "\t";
}

14. Write a short program that declares and initializs double variables one, two, three, four and five to the values 1.000, 1.414, 1.732, 2.000 and 2.236. 
Generate a legend and table

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "\tN\tSquare Root\n";
    cout << "\t1\t1.000\n";
    cout << "\t2\t1.414\n";
    cout << "\t3\t1.732\n";
    cout << "\t4\t2.000\n";
    cout << "\t5\t2.236\n";
}



15.Convert each math expression to C++
3x = 3 * x;
3x + y = 3*x + y;
(x + y) / 7 = (x + y) / 7; 
(3x +y)/ (z + 2) = (3*x + y)/(z + 2);


16 What is the output when embedded in a program that declares everyting to char?
a = 'b';
b = 'c';
c = a;
cout << a << b << c << 'c';
prints : bcbc


17. What is the output of the following program lines when embedded in a program that declares number to be an int?
number = (1/3) *3
cout << "(1/3) * 3 is equal to " << number; 
prints 0


18. Write a C++ program that takes in two inputs and gives the division and then the remainder

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number1, number2;
    cout<< "Give me two numbers to divide by" << endl;
    cin >> number1;
    cout<< "Give me the 2nd number to divide by" <<endl;
    cin >>number2;
    cout<< "The division of the two numbers is: "<<number1 / number2 <<endl;
    cout<< "The remainder of the two numbers is: "<<number1 % number2 <<endl;
}



19. Given the fragment, correct the code and answer the questions
  double c = 20;
  double f;
  f = (9/5) * c +32.0;
  a. What value is assigned to f?
    52
  b. Explain what is actually happening and what the programmer wanted to do
    he converted 20C to F but the answer is 68, not 52
  c. Rewrite the code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int C = 20.0;
    int F;
    F = (C*9)/5 + 32.0;
    
    cout << F << endl;
}   



20. What is the output of this string? 
month = "03";
day = "04";
year = "06"; 
date = month + date + year;
cout <<date<<endl;
technically error if didn't declare string but ok 
prints - 030406
