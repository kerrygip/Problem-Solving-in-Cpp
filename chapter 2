******PRACTICE PROGRAMS*******

1. Write a C++ program. A metric ton is 35,273.92 oz

Also a program that will calculate how many boxes it will take to yield 1 ton of cereal.




2. Write a program that:
  a. inputs a double as the base an int as exponent
  b. multiples base number by itself using a loop for the number of times in int
  c. outputs exponential
 extra credit: use an if statement for 0 exponential (answer is 1) and write it so that it will deal with a negative exponent
 
 
 
 3. Convert a treadmill timer that converts mph to minutes and seconds per mile. Ex. 6.5mph should be 9 minutes and 13.8 seconds/mile.
