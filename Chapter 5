*** SELF TEST EXERCISES ***

1. What does this output?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void friendly();
void shy(int audienceCount);

int main(){
    friendly();
    shy(6);
    cout<< "one more time "<< endl;
    shy(2);
    friendly();
    cout << "end "<< endl;
}

void friendly(){
    cout<<"hello "<< endl;
}

void shy(int audienceCount){
    if (audienceCount <5)
        return;
    cout <<"dueces" << endl;
}


// input
hello                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
dueces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
one more time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
hello                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
end 


2.Are you supposed to have a return statement in a void function?
no

3. Suppose you omitted return in the function definition for initializeScren in 5.2. What efect would it have on the program?
it wouldnt do anything different. I usually don't use return functions 


4. Write a definition of a void function that has three arguments of type int and that outputs to the sfcreen the product of these three arguments. 
Put the definitoin in a program that reads in three numbers and then calls the function

5. Does your compiler allow void main() and int main()? What warnings are issued if you have int main() and do not supply a return 0?
- if no return, I'm fine
- if used void main() - compiler said needs to return int

6. Is a call to void function used as a statment or is it used as an expression?
Statement


//Call by reference example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void getNumbers(int& input1, int& input2);
// & is a call by reference

void swapValues(int& variable1, int& variable2);

void showResults(int output1, int output2);

int main(){
    
    int firstNum = 0, secondNum = 0;
    
    getNumbers(firstNum, secondNum);
    swapValues(firstNum, secondNum);
    showResults(firstNum, secondNum);
}

void getNumbers(int& input1, int& input2){
    cout<< "enter two numbers "<< endl;
    cin>> input1 >> input2;
}

void swapValues(int& variable1, int& variable2){
    int temp;
    temp = variable1;
    variable1 = variable2;
    variable2 = temp;
    // so temp = variable1 and 2??
}

void showResults(int output1, int output2){
    cout<<"in reverse the numbers are " << output1 <<" and " << output2 << endl;
}


// formal call by reference needs & by type : int& variable1



7. What is the output of the following program?
#include <iostream>
void figureMeOut(int& x, int y, int& z);
int main()
{
using namespace std;
int a, b, c;
a = 10;
b = 20;
c = 30;
figureMeOut(a, b, c);
cout << a << " " << b << " " << c;
return 0;
}
void figureMeOut(int& x, int y, int& z)
{
using namespace std;
cout << x << " " << y << " " << z << endl;
x = 1;
y = 2;
z = 3;
cout << x << " " << y << " " << z << endl;
}
8. What would be the output of the program in Display 5.4 if you omit the
ampersands, &, from the first parameter in the function declaration and
function heading of swapValues? The ampersand is not removed from the
second parameter.
9. What would be the output of the program in Display 5.6 if you change
the function declaration for the function doStuff to the following and
you change the function header to match, so that the formal parameter
par2Ref is changed to a call-by-value parameter:
void doStuff(int par1Value, int par2Ref);
10. Write a void function definition for a function called zeroBoth that has
two reference parameters, both of which are variables of type int, and sets
the values of both variables to 0.
11. Write a void function definition for a function called addTax. The function
addTax has two formal parameters: taxRate, which is the amount of sales
tax expressed as a percentage, and cost, which is the cost of an item before
tax. The function changes the value of cost so that it includes sales tax.
12. Can a function that returns a value have a call-by-reference parameter?
May a function have both call-by-value and call-by-reference parameters?
