*** SELF TEST EXERCISES ***

1. What does this output?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void friendly();
void shy(int audienceCount);

int main(){
    friendly();
    shy(6);
    cout<< "one more time "<< endl;
    shy(2);
    friendly();
    cout << "end "<< endl;
}

void friendly(){
    cout<<"hello "<< endl;
}

void shy(int audienceCount){
    if (audienceCount <5)
        return;
    cout <<"dueces" << endl;
}


// input
hello                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
dueces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
one more time

end 


2.Are you supposed to have a return statement in a void function?
no

3. Suppose you omitted return in the function definition for initializeScren in 5.2. What efect would it have on the program?
it wouldnt do anything different. I usually don't use return functions 


4. Write a definition of a void function that has three arguments of type int and that outputs to the sfcreen the product of these three arguments. 
Put the definitoin in a program that reads in three numbers and then calls the function

5. Does your compiler allow void main() and int main()? What warnings are issued if you have int main() and do not supply a return 0?
- if no return, I'm fine
- if used void main() - compiler said needs to return int

6. Is a call to void function used as a statment or is it used as an expression?
Statement


//Call by reference example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void getNumbers(int& input1, int& input2);
// & is a call by reference

void swapValues(int& variable1, int& variable2);

void showResults(int output1, int output2);

int main(){
    
    int firstNum = 0, secondNum = 0;
    
    getNumbers(firstNum, secondNum);
    swapValues(firstNum, secondNum);
    showResults(firstNum, secondNum);
}

void getNumbers(int& input1, int& input2){
    cout<< "enter two numbers "<< endl;
    cin>> input1 >> input2;
}

void swapValues(int& variable1, int& variable2){
    int temp;
    temp = variable1;
    variable1 = variable2;
    variable2 = temp;
    // so temp = variable1 and 2??
}

void showResults(int output1, int output2){
    cout<<"in reverse the numbers are " << output1 <<" and " << output2 << endl;
}


// formal call by reference needs & by type : int& variable1
